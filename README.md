# Quiz App ðŸ§ ðŸŽ¯

## Overview

This **Quiz App** allows users to test their knowledge by selecting various quiz options. The app is built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in JavaScript, making it modular, reusable, and scalable.

Users can select the **category**, **difficulty level**, and the **number of questions** they want to answer. The app fetches trivia questions from the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/), and after each question, feedback is given for correct or incorrect answers. At the end of the quiz, the user is presented with their total score and a final feedback message.
